## OVERVIEW
XGate — 9质量门禁 + AI多专家评审的自动化开发工作流。 Implements Sprint Flow (One-Shot Sprint 自动流水线), Delphi review with dual modes (design + code-walkthrough), test-specification alignment, lightweight specification auto-generation, Boy Scout Rule enforcement, multi-language principles checker, and Zero-Tolerance quality gate enforcement.

## CONVENTIONS
- All quality gates in githooks are "zero tolerance" - tools must be available or operations are blocked
- **No bypassing gates**: `--no-verify` is strictly prohibited when tools report errors (see githooks/QUALITY-GATES-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
- Use Delphi method for multi-expert consensus (delphi-review design/code-walkthrough modes)
- Two-phase test verification: Phase 1 (align tests with spec), Phase 2 (execute locked tests)
- Custom thresholds via `.principlesrc`: long-function 50, god-class 15, deep-nesting 4, CCN warning 5, CCN block 10
- Magic numbers whitelist: [0, 1, -1, 2, 10, 100, 1000, 60, 24, 7, 30, 365, 256, 1024]
- Coverage threshold: 80% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Push limits: max 20 files or 500 LOC per push
- Boy Scout Rule: auto-initializes baseline on first touch; modified files cannot increase warnings; ≤5 baseline warnings must clear to zero; new files zero-tolerance
- Test annotations: @test REQ-XXX, @intent, @covers AC-XXX required for specification alignment
- Specification.yaml is auto-generated after delphi-review APPROVED; no manual editing required

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)
- Do NOT skip test-specification alignment when tests need modification in Phase 2
- Do NOT exceed 20 file changes or 500 LOC changes per git push
- Do NOT bypass githooks quality gates via command-line flags (especially `--no-verify`)
- Do NOT claim Delphi review complete without APPROVED verdict
- Do NOT auto-degrade quality gates on cost/environment issues - MUST BLOCK and notify user
- Do NOT modify frozen tests during Phase 2 execution
- Do NOT skip Boy Scout Rule (always runs — auto-initializes baseline when missing)
- Do NOT use `git push --no-verify` to skip code review (per QUALITY-GATES-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## UNIQUE STYLES
- Lightweight specification.yaml auto-generated from APPROVED design docs (no version management, no conflict detection)
- JSDoc-style tags (@test, @intent, @covers) link tests to requirements
- Freeze/unfreeze mechanism protects test files during Phase 2 execution
- SARIF 2.1.0 output format for IDE/GitHub Actions integration
- Skills defined as SKILL.md files (markdown) not executable code
- Differential warning enforcement via Boy Scout Rule (auto-baseline initialization)
- Regex-based AST extraction for C++ and Objective-C (Phase 1 approach)
- Quality Gates Code of Conduct enforces zero-tolerance for tool-reported errors

## COMMANDS
```bash
# Git workflow with quality gates
git commit  # -> pre-commit (9 Gates)
git push    # -> pre-push (Delphi code walkthrough review)

# Manual execution of automation tools
/sprint-flow "开发访谈机器人，支持多轮对话"
/delphi-review                          # Design mode (default)
/delphi-review --mode code-walkthrough  # Code walkthrough mode (git push review)
/test-specification-alignment

# Principles checker (Clean Code + SOLID)
npx tsx src/principles/index.ts --files "src/**/*.ts" --format console

# Boy Scout Rule (standalone)
npx tsx src/principles/boy-scout.ts --new-files a.ts --modified-files b.ts --baseline .warnings-baseline.json
npx tsx src/principles/boy-scout.ts --init-baseline
```

## NOTES
- This project implements enterprise-grade AI-assisted development workflow
- Quality gates block operations until required tools are available
- Documentation-only projects skip code analysis but still verify specifications
