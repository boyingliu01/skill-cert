# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Gate 9: Architecture Quality** - Clean Architecture layer boundary validation
  - TypeScript: archlint (@archlinter/cli) >= 2.0.0
  - Python: deply >= 0.5.0
  - Go: goarchtest
  - Java: ArchUnit
  - C++: Phase 2 roadmap (requires `.skip-architecture-cpp` marker)
- **architecture.yaml** template with layer definitions and rules
  - 14 architecture rules: ARCH-001 to ARCH-014
  - Layer boundary enforcement (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Baseline/ratchet mode support
  - SARIF output integration
- **version-parser.ts**: Tool version compatibility checker
- **Gate 9 bats tests**: 18 test cases for shell script validation

### Changed
- Gate count: 8 → 9 (added Architecture Quality)
- TOOL-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md: Added architecture tool installation
- README.md: Added Gate 9 documentation
- specification.yaml: Added REQ-ARCH-001 to REQ-ARCH-009

### Delphi Review Verified
- Round 1 → Round 2 → APPROVED (100% consensus, 9.67/10 confidence)
- Experts: delphi-reviewer-architecture, delphi-reviewer-technical, delphi-reviewer-feasibility
- Critical issues fixed: tool name, version checks, C++ skip marker

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Issue #7**: Code walkthrough pre-push hook CLI invocation error
  - Root cause: OpenCode CLI doesn't support skill subcommands
  - Solution: Replace CLI call with file validation (`.code-walkthrough-result.json`)
  - Hook validates: commit match, verdict=APPROVED, not expired (<1hr)
  - Skill executes in Agent session, writes result file
  - Decision: "mandatory but manually triggered" quality gate
- **Delphi Review**: code-walkthrough Round 1-3 → APPROVED (Expert A/B 9/10)

### Changed
- `githooks/pre-push`: 305 → 145 lines (file validation only)
- `skills/code-walkthrough/SKILL.md`: 276 → 469 lines (added result output)
- OpenCode environment: synced with latest fixes

### Added
- **specification-generator UPDATE mode**: Modify existing spec with Delphi review

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Boy Scout Rule** (Gate 8): Differential warning enforcement for historical projects
  - `boy-scout.ts`: File classification, delta calculation, baseline management
  - `baseline.ts`: Warning history storage (.warnings-baseline.json)
  - New files: zero-tolerance, Modified files: decrease-or-maintain
- **Objective-C Adapter**: Regex-based extraction for .m/.mm files
  - @implementation/@interface parsing
  - Objective-C method declarations
- **C++ Adapter**: Regex-based extraction for .cpp/.c/.h files
  - Function extraction with const/override/noexcept
  - Class/struct with inheritance
- **Gate 7 CCN**: lizard integration for C++/Objective-C cyclomatic complexity
- **Test annotations**: @test REQ-XXX, @intent, @covers AC-XXX format
- **specification.yaml**: YAML-based requirements and acceptance criteria

### Changed
- Gate count: 7 → 8 (added Boy Scout Rule)
- Language adapters: 7 → 9 (added C++, Objective-C)
- Test count: 166 → 257 tests
- Coverage: 94% → 85%+ (still above threshold)

### Fixed
- TypeScript strict mode issues in test files
- AdapterFactory null return type handling
- LSP rule parameter type annotation

### XP Consensus Verified
- Gate 1: PASS (TypeScript + Tests + Coverage)
- Navigator Phase 1: REQUEST_CHANGES
- Navigator Phase 2: APPROVED (confidence 10/10)
- Arbiter: APPROVED

## [0.0.2] - 2025-04-11

### Added
- **Hook-based Quality Gates**: Code-level enforcement replacing soft prompt constraints
- **Iron Law Workflow**: Mandatory verification before implementation
- **Delphi Review System**: Multi-expert consensus (≥91% threshold)
- **XP Consensus Engine**: Driver + Navigator + Arbiter decision workflow
- **Code Walkthrough**: Multi-model post-commit review
- **Test-Specification Alignment**: Two-phase verification

### Changed
- Addressed AI agent "shortcut-taking" problem from v0.0.1
- Zero-tolerance for quality gate tools availability
- No degradation on cost/environment issues

### Design Decisions
- Hook-based gates over stronger prompts (100% reliability vs ~30%)
- SARIF 2.1.0 output for IDE integration
- Skills as SKILL.md markdown (not executable code)

## [0.0.1] - 2025-03-XX

### Added
- Initial XGate framework
- Principles checker with Clean Code + SOLID rules
- Git hooks framework
- Basic skill structure

### Known Issues
- AI agent shortcut-taking behavior (addressed in v0.0.2)
